couldn't get the header to "stretch" across the screen, so I just made it big. is it just the container 
that stretches across the screen?

next time I would want the buttons to be closer together, would I make them into a grid and assign cells?

on different browsers the "required" for the email and password was different before I had the red text visible,
on firefox it didn't show anything and on chrome and edge it said the field was required but didn't show the
text that I had put in the invalid-feeback div. also when it had .was-validated vs .needs-validation, I didn't
like the way it looked, it had the input field border red, so i kept it at .needs-validation and found some 
help online to just show the red text underneath by adding d-block.
