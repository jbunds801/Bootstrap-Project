I struggled a bit with this one, mostly knowing where exactly to put the classes. Some you want to put in 
the div, some you want to put in the p or the table or the form. But after messing around with it for a bit I 
started to get it some more I think! It took me a few days and I feel like it shouldn't have with all that I 
learned from the event center website so I felt a bit frustrated at times, but then again I suppose it's about 
the same as learning to use CSS.

I tried to have fun with this one too even though there wasn't really any requirements to do so. I was able to 
use a lot of resources from the Bootstrap website, Coding Temple website and also W3Schools also had a lot of 
helpful info too. I was able to find some solutions just doing a regular web search too, and I had to have AI 
help me with some stuff as well. 

The Bootstrap website was the most helpful for little things like adding a letter after m or p for corresponding 
sides, but didn't seem like a lot of the info I got from there on specific things like trying to have a certain 
amount of space between my buttons, which I didn't figure out how to do anyways! I'm thinking next time I would 
want to made them into a grid and assign a certain amount of columns to them but I wasn't sure if there was a 
different way other than d-flex justify-content-... 

I was able to just paste and copy some stuff from the lessons too, like I did for the nav bar and then I just 
made some adjustments to it, as well as the form. I did mess around with the default settings on all of the
containers for stuff like padding and margins and font sizes. Some things I got from W3Schools too, and the 
buttons I just copied from the Bootstrap website, since those are pretty simple. A lot of things on the Bootstrap 
website didn't make sense to me. 

The AI helped me with things like getting images centered but it again still didn't provide very good solutions
to some problems I had, maybe I'm just not specific enough in what I am asking for. I tried to have it help me 
find a way to have the header stretch beyond it's actual size on larger screens but it didn't work. I had to 
just go into photoshop and make it bigger myself, I made it to 2200px width which should covers almost all of 
the screen on my desktop. I was able to do searches online for more specific things, like white text on the 
nav bar and even how to change the shape of the circle, but I liked the default shape of the circle anyways! 

I wasn't able to find anything about changing the font style using just Bootstrap and no CSS, so I figured that
is for a later lesson or a project where we will be implementing all the things!

Another thing that I struggled with was validation for the email and password section. I felt like there was a 
lot of different ways to do it from what I could tell, and honestly the examples on Bootstrap's website are
confusing. It assumes you know a lot more than I do at this point I think haha. The solution I liked the most was
on W3Schools again! The solution on Bootstrap's website made it so that the input fields had a red border and the 
message with the .invalid-feedback all the time. Then when I found a way to have it not showing the error message 
before even entering any info, it didn't display the message I had with the .invalid-feeback, it was different
on different browsers. Firefox didn't show any message at all, just showing a drop down link to manage my log
ins, and on Chrome and Edge it showed a little flag that just said that the field was required. So I didn't know
how to get around that, but I the solution I found on W3Schools showed the .was-validated which left the red text
and the red border, but then I was able to find some help doing a search to add .d-block with the .invalid-feeback
to only show the red text and not the border so I was happy with that.

Overall though I think it turned out pretty good!
